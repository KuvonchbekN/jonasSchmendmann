-----------Map and Set---------------
//API : 3 of them 
1)from program itself 
2)from the UI
3)from external sources (API) =>[for example from weather web app which i take information and store them intro arrays, or objects or sets and maps]
//these can be called data structures (objects and arrays )

//USE ARRAYS or SETS when i need a list of items 
SETS(unique values and high-perfomance and remove the duplicates from an array)==ARRAYS(useful when ordered or to manipulate the data)

//USE OBJECTS OR MAPS when i need key/value pairs 
MAPS(easy to iterate; easy to compute the size; better perfomance; when i need to map key to values; when keys are not string and with Map we can use any data type>but not the functions)==OBJECTS(easier to access values with . and []; when to use the functions and 'this' keyword; when working with JSON(CAN BE CONVERTED TO Map));
